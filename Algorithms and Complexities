quickSort
	-pick an element randomly (pivot)
	-walk through the array from both sides (left-right right-left) until you find an element out of order on both sides
	-swap elements if theyre out of order (left of the pivot should be smaller than pivot, right should be bigger)
	-repeat until the pointer for both sides encouter each other
	-do quickSort on both sides reccursevely
	
	Complexity: O(nlogn) average
		    O(n) very bad
